Reinstalling grub-efi on your hard drive

Check that the computer booted in computer in EFI mode:

[ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo "EFI boot on HDD" || echo "Legacy boot on HDD"
should return "EFI boot on HDD".

After starting a root shell ( if you boot from a live media, you should start a chroot shell instead, as explained in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#via_ChRoot ) check that your EFI system partition (most probably /dev/sda1) is mounted on /boot/efi. If the /boot/efi directory does not exist, you will need to create it.

mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi

Reinstall the grub-efi package

apt-get install --reinstall grub-efi

Put the debian bootloader in /boot/efi and create an appropriate entry in the computer NVRAM

grub-install /dev/sda

Re create a grub config file based on your disk partitioning schema

update-grub

You should check afterwards that:

Check 1. the bootloader is existing in /boot/efi/EFI/debian/grubx64.efi

file /boot/efi/EFI/debian/grubx64.efi

/boot/efi/EFI/debian/grubx64.efi: PE32+ executable (EFI application) x86-64 (stripped to external PDB), for MS Windows

Check 2. the nvram entry was properly created.

efibootmgr --verbose | grep debian

You can now reboot, and Grub should greet you.
