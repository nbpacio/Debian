How to upgrade the Debian 10 kernel from backports without recompiling it from scratch

1. enable backports:

echo deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main contrib non-free | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/buster-backports.list

2. install the backported kernel:

sudo apt install -t buster-backports linux-image-amd64
(the new kernel will be installed alongside your current kernel, so you can always boot the latter if things go wrong)

3. Update Repo:
sudo apt update

4. install the firmware:

sudo apt install -t buster-backports firmware-linux firmware-linux-nonfree

5. Reboot
