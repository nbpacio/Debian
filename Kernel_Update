A. How to upgrade the Debian 10 kernel from backports without recompiling it from scratch

1. enable backports:

echo deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main contrib non-free | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/buster-backports.list

2. install the backported kernel:

sudo apt install -t buster-backports linux-image-amd64
(the new kernel will be installed alongside your current kernel, so you can always boot the latter if things go wrong)

3. Update Repo:
sudo apt update

4. install the firmware:  

sudo apt install -t buster-backports firmware-linux firmware-linux-nonfree

5. Reboot


B. How to upgrade kernel from source:


https://linuxhint.com/how-to-upgrade-kernel-of-debian-9-stretch-from-source/


1. Check installed version:

  $ uname -r

2. Download latest kernel from https://www.kernel.org or debian source:

3. Install required tools:

  $ sudo apt-get update
  
  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev gcc libssl-dev bc bison flex rsync libelf-dev
  
4. Compiling Kernel:

  $ cd ~/Downloads
  
  $ tar xvf linux-4.14.7.tar.xz
  
  $ cd linux-4.14.7
  
5. Copy boot configuration:

  $ cp -v /boot/config-4.9.0-3-amd64 .config  <--- current kernel version number
  
6. The new kernel may have a lot of new features that the old kernel didn’t have. 
  So it’s a good idea to run the following command to convert the old configuration file to a new one. 
  Otherwise we will be asked a lot of questions that might not make sense to you.
  
  $ make menuconfig
  
7. Now run the following command to start the kernel compilation process:

  $ make deb-pkg
  
  The compilation process takes a very long time to finish.
  
  NOTE:
  Attempting to compile kernel yields a certification error:

8. Now all we have to do to update the kernel is to install all the generated .deb files.

  Run the following command to update the kernel:

  $ sudo dpkg -i ../linux-*.deb
  
9. Now restart your computer with the following command:

  $ sudo reboot
  
10. Once the computer boots, run the following command to check the kernel version:

  $ uname -r
  
11. Note, if you have more than one kernel installed, you can arrange them by using grub-customizer app.

12. You can remove old kernels by:

sudo dpkg --list | egrep -i --color 'linux-image|linux-headers'

df -h

sudo apt remove --purge linux-headers-<version> linux-image-<version>
