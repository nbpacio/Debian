The solution is pretty simple. Just create a text file named 20-intel.conf in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ directory path (you may have to create directory xorg.conf.d if it does not exist) and paste the following in it:

Section "Device"
  Identifier "Intel Graphics"
  Driver "intel"
EndSection

Now save the file and reboot your Debian Xfce system.

Screen black problem after locking the screen in Xfce should be solved by now.
